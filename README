== ABOUT ==
	Copisterio is a proyect born in Downgrade Zaragoza's Hacklab. 
	Copisterio is made of terminals with information 
	(movies, linux distros, free software, ascii porn... ;) ) 
	and allows it to be copied onto removable discs.
	Also, copisterio may allow users to add new documents.
	It's a system similar to face2face's way of share things 
	(promoted by [compartiresbueno.net])

== LICENSE ==
	Licensing things are located in "License" File.

== BUGS == 
	Copisterio has a googlecode webpage where you can 
	submit bugs. Thanks! 

== CONFIGURATION ==
	For main configuration (defaults are ok but...) you might 
	have a look at /usr/share/copisterio/*.config
	You can change, for example, the command to remove things 
	from rm to wipe, if you're looking for security. Or logfiles.

	For the web server's configuration, you should look at your 
	web server's docs, actually it have been tested only on 
	apache2 but should work on any perl-cgi capable web server.

== REQUERIMENTS ==
	Copisterio requires an updated version of perl, a web server 
	with perl-cgi capabilities and mplayer.
	
== INSTALLING ==
	I've recently made a Makefile for copisterio. 
	When packaging for debian you can make it create a initscript 
	based on a file, so I've splitted out the default (install) 
	function and the all function.
	When calling make with all arg, it installs the initscript.
	When calling make without args or with install arg it doesnt, 
	this is the way to do the package if someone's interested.

== TECH INFO ==
	Copisterio is made of three scripts and a CGI.
	Copisterio_ttc --> This scripts copy the contents of temp 
		directory to check directory and changes its mode
		It also calls copisterio_mt to create thumbs.
	Copisterio_mt --> This script is based on "Movie Thumnailer"
		It creates screenshots for use with CGI.
	index.pl  --> This is the main page script for administration
		purposes.
	And it uses some conffiles, located at /usr/share/copisterio/
